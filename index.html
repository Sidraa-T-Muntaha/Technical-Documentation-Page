                To work with React Native, you will need to have an understanding of JavaScript fundamentals.
                If you’re new to JavaScript or need a refresher,
                you can dive in or brush up at Mozilla Developer Network.

                    While we do our best to assume no prior knowledge of React, Android, or iOS development,
                    these are valuable topics of study for the aspiring React Native developer.
                    Where sensible, we have linked to resources and articles that go more in depth.

                    People from many different development backgrounds are learning React Native.
                    You may have experience with a range of technologies, from web to Android to iOS and more.
                    We try to write for developers from all backgrounds.

                        With React, you can make components using either classes or functions.
                        Originally, class components were the only components that could have state.
                        But since the introduction of React's Hooks API, you can add state and more to
                        function components.</li>
